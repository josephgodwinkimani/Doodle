# Getting Started

<div class="documentation__toc"></div>

## Start your first project

1. Just clone the repo

2. Create your first project 

Run the following commands inside the cloned repo:

```bash
# start the psy shell
$ php console.php psy:shell
# create a project without support for any template engine
> $I = new Doodle\CreateProject("Bull");
= null
# create a project called Cat that supports Twig Template engine
>  $I = new Doodle\CreateProject("Cat"); $I->twig();
# response
= null
# OR create a project called Horse that supports Pug Template engine 
>  $I = new Doodle\CreateProject("Cat"); $I->pug();
# response
= null
```

File structure will be as follows:

```

├── config/          
│   └── entity-config.php    # add paths to your doctrine entities here
│
├── src/                     # project root
│   ├── MyFirstProject/     
│   │   ├── Cache/           # twig or pug cache goes here
│   │   ├── Controller/      
│   │   ├── Model/          
│   │   └── Template/        # keep twig or pug class, add your views here
│   ├── Doodle               # contains the framework - DO NOT DELETE
│   ├── Entities             # contains the database entities - DO NOT DELETE
│   ├── console.php          # add the classes you want to access on PsySH here
│   └── route.php            # add your routes here
├── composer.json            # add your project dependencies here
├── .env
└── logs                     # your app logs are here
```

Alternatively, you can use a demo project: 

1. Leap Year Calendar - `src/Calendar` whose view is `http://localhost/is_leap_year/{year}` e.g. `2088`
2. Market - `src/Market` using orm and twig template engine 
3. Dog - `src/Dog` using pug template engine
4. Cat - `src/Cat` showing how to create and render html forms

_Note: You can choose to delete all the folders under `src/` in exception of **Doodle**, and **Entities**._
