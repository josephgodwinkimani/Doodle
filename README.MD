[Doodle][1] _- The PHP Framework_ is an attempt to create a simple and minimal **HTTP PHP framework** whose goal is **make the code more adaptable to change without breaking, as well as to make it simple to understand and modify**. Based on [Symfony Components][2] and other libraries.

Built for developing framework-agnostic apis and web applications without bloat.

## Why?

This [framework][3] is a _Doodle_. The concept is aimed at capitalizing on existing expertise and developing a somewhat user-friendly, fairly opinionated and deployable framework to facilitate rapid application development without the intricacies associated with contemporary frameworks.

## Features

-  Model First ORM
-  Environment variables
-  File Storage (Local, SFTP, ZipArchive)
-  Low-level Symfony HTTP client with support for both PHP stream wrappers and cURL
-  SEO-friendly routing
-  Rate Limiting
-  Validation
-  Templates for web designers (Pug, Twig)
-  REPL
-  MVC
-  New Project Scaffolding
