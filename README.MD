[Doodle][1] _- The PHP Framework_ is an attempt to create a simple and minimal **HTTP PHP framework** whose goal is **make the code more adaptable to change without breaking, as well as to make it simple to understand and modify**. Based on [Symfony Components][2] and other libraries.

Built for developing framework-agnostic apis and web applications without bloat.

## Why?
